## The Engineering Challenge
Seattle's topography poses a unique "Last Mile" problem for accessibility. Traditional analysis relies on static counts. **Our goal:** To move beyond descriptive statistics and build a **predictive engine** that quantifies "Mobility Friction"—the block-by-block resistance faced by pedestrians with disabilities.

We processed **82,000+ crowdsourced data points** to answer the critical question: *Where does the infrastructure fail the user?*

## System Architecture: The Stacking Ensemble
We rejected simple linear regression in favor of a **Stacking Ensemble Regressor** to capture high-variance spatial dependencies.

### The Pipeline
1.  **Ingestion:** Raw CSV parsing (~82k rows) from Seattle Open Data.
2.  **Preprocessing:** * `StandardScaler` for numerical features.
    * `OneHotEncoder` for categorical barrier types.
    * **Spatial Feature Engineering:** Calculated `Dist_to_Center` and `Block_Variance`.
3.  **The Model (Stacking):**
    * **Level 1 (Base Learners):** * `RandomForestRegressor` (captures non-linear interactions).
        * `GradientBoostingRegressor` (reduces bias).
        * `KNeighborsRegressor` (models spatial autocorrelation/clustering).
    * **Level 2 (Meta-Learner):**
        * `RidgeCV` (optimizes the final weightings to prevent overfitting).

> **Performance:** The model achieves a robust **R² Score** (see logs), validated via 5-Fold Cross-Validation.

## Key Insights & Deliverables

| Datathon Question | Engineering Insight |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Q3: Variance** | **Hyper-local Disparity.** Boxplot analysis reveals that accessibility is not a neighborhood problem, but a block-by-block struggle. High variance in *Downtown* proves the need for granular prediction. |
| **Q5: Hotspots** | **DBSCAN Clustering.** We identified 12 critical "Friction Zones" (red clusters on map) where barrier density exceeds 2 standard deviations. |
| **Q6: Drivers** | **Lasso Feature Selection.** `No Sidewalk` has the highest coefficient weight, significantly outranking temporary construction barriers. |
| **Q7: The Solution** | **The Accessibility Index.** A dynamic 1-5 score generated by our Stacking Model, predicting severity even for unmapped coordinates. |
